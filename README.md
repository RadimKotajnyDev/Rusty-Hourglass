# Sands of Time ⏳

*A Rust ASCII Hourglass Animation*

---

### About

In the stillness of a console window,
time takes shape.
Grains of light and shadow fall,
and an hourglass begins to breathe.

This project is a simple Rust program that draws and animates an ASCII hourglass.
It was born during a lecture, in a moment where boredom asked for creativity,
and the sands of time decided to dance on the terminal screen.

---

### Features

* ASCII-rendered hourglass, drawn in your terminal
* Animation loop simulating falling sands
* Cross-platform (works anywhere ANSI escape codes are supported)
* Written in pure Rust with no external dependencies (except your imagination)

---

### How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RadimKotajnyDev/Rusty-Hourglass.git
cd Rusty-Hourglass
cargo run
```

---

### Inspiration

Sometimes boredom becomes the best teacher.
This project is less about code,
and more about letting time flow—
one frame, one character, one grain at a time.

---

### License

Do whatever you want with it.
Just don’t forget: time is precious.
